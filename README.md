This project is a sample of use of the YOLOv8 tracking feature, in this project we used this feature to count how many cars is crossing the road when a traffic light is not red. Just using a camera to detect the scene, the YOLOv8 tracker and detector, and finally a little bit of own coding to make the whole thing to work.
